# FTC-linear-slides-3d-Simulation-2021-2022-
Here is a github repo so anyone in ftc can simulate what length they need to extend their slides to, what angle of elevation, and horizontal angle.

Use the pynb file (first one) and open it in google collab to use the simulation free of memory, downloading stuff, and easy access.

If you would like, download the .py file (robot_simulation) and run it on your personal console to get a more in depth and interactive version of the 3d model.  (You will be able to see the 3d model and any angle you chose)
